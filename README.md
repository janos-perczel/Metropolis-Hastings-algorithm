# Metropolis-Hastings-algorithm

A pedagogical implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm to decode an encoded text, where there is a 1-to-1
mapping the letters of the original alphabet and the encryption alphabet. Note that the emphasis was on pedagogical
clarity rather than code optimization.
